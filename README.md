# System Design Resource Library

Welcome to the comprehensive System Design library. This project contains in-depth explanations, real-time use cases, and code examples for various design patterns and architectural concepts.

## 🏗️ High-Level Design (HLD)
Core architectural components for scalable distributed systems.
- [Load Balancing](./HLD/load-balancing.md) - Distributing traffic across servers.
- [Caching](./HLD/caching.md) - Improving performance with Redis/Memcached.
- [Message Queues](./HLD/message-queues.md) - Asynchronous communication with RabbitMQ/Kafka.
- [Database Sharding](./HLD/database-sharding.md) - Horizontal scaling of databases.
- [Microservices](./HLD/microservices.md) - Building independent, deployable services.
- [Replication & Consistency](./HLD/replication-consistency.md) - CAP theorem and data synchronization.
- [CDN (Content Delivery Network)](./HLD/cdn.md) - Serving content from the edge.
- [Circuit Breaker](./HLD/circuit-breaker.md) - Handling cascading failures.
- [Service Discovery](./HLD/service-discovery.md) - Finding dynamic services.

## 🛠️ Low-Level Design (LLD)
Principles and patterns for writing clean, maintainable, and efficient code.
- [SOLID Principles](./LLD/solid-principles.md) - The foundation of OOP design.
- [Strategy Pattern](./LLD/strategy-pattern.md) - Interchangeable algorithms (e.g., Payment methods).
- [Observer Pattern](./LLD/observer-pattern.md) - One-to-many event notification.
- [Factory Pattern](./LLD/factory-pattern.md) - Decoupling object creation.
- [Singleton Pattern](./LLD/singleton-pattern.md) - Ensuring single instances (Thread-safe).
- [Builder Pattern](./LLD/builder-pattern.md) - Constructing complex objects fluently.
- [Decorator Pattern](./LLD/decorator-pattern.md) - Adding behavior dynamically.
- [Command Pattern](./LLD/command-pattern.md) - Encapsulating requests as objects (Undo/Redo).
- [Parking Lot Design](./LLD/parking-lot.md) - A classic LLD interview case study.
